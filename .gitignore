#if we push a code to repo first time then we only write a path of removing files in .gitignore file
#like this   Cars_Collision/car             Cars_Collision/cars 

#But if you push a code without writing that command then we have to write this command in git repo folder           git rm -r --cached Cars_Collision/cars
